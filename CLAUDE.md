This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is PrSAT?

PrSAT (Probability Satisfiability) is a web-based tool for checking satisfiability of probabilistic constraints. Users enter constraints involving probabilities (e.g., `Pr(A) > Pr(B)`, `Pr(A|B) = 1/2`) and the tool uses the Z3 SMT solver to find a probability distribution satisfying all constraints, or reports UNSAT if none exists.

**Live deployment:** https://fitelson.org/PrSAT/

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** TypeScript + Vite, runs entirely in browser
- **Solver:** Z3 compiled to WebAssembly (z3-solver npm package)
- **Key constraint:** Z3 WASM requires SharedArrayBuffer, which needs cross-origin isolation headers

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/text_to_display.ts` | Main UI logic, input handling, result display |
| `src/z3_integration.ts` | Z3 solver interface, model parsing, evaluation |
| `src/pr_sat.ts` | Constraint translation, truth table generation |
| `src/parser.ts` | Parsing probability expressions |
| `src/block_playground.ts` | Constraint input block UI (Load, Save, Clear, Batch) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Local changes (not committed to upstream) |

## How It Works

1. User enters constraints like `Pr(A) > Pr(B)`, `Pr(A|B) = 1/2`
2. Parser converts to AST representation
3. Constraints translated to state variable sums (one variable `a_i` per truth table row)
4. One state variable eliminated (set equal to `1 - sum of others`) for efficiency
5. Z3 solves the resulting QF_NRA (quantifier-free nonlinear real arithmetic) problem
6. If SAT, model displayed as probability table with assignments

## State Variables

- Named `a_1, a_2, ...` (1-indexed) in display
- Internally 0-indexed
- Last variable eliminated: `a_n = 1 - (a_1 + ... + a_{n-1})`
- Each `a_i` represents probability of one row of the truth table

## Irrational Number Display

Z3 returns algebraic numbers as `root-obj` expressions (roots of polynomials).

- **Quadratic irrationals (degree 2):** Displayed as simplified `(-b ± √D) / 2a` form with decimal approximation
- **Higher degree:** Displayed as "Root #N of [polynomial]"

Simplification extracts perfect squares from radical, reduces by GCD.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Local dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build            # TypeScript compile + Vite build
npx vitest --run         # Unit tests only (fast)
npm test                 # Unit + Playwright e2e tests (slower)
npx vitest --allowOnly   # Run single test (add .only to test)
npx playwright test --project chromium tests/simple.spec.ts  # Single e2e test
```

## Deployment Notes

- This is a **local fork** for fitelson.org deployment
- Upstream repo: `imapersonman/PrSAT` (changes here not committed there)
- `dist/.htaccess` required for Apache servers (cross-origin isolation headers)
- iOS Safari requires proper COEP/COOP headers for SharedArrayBuffer

## Recent Work (2026-01)

- Added Clear button for constraint entry (resets to single empty input)
- Fixed division-by-zero detection in model evaluator
- Added "Save table as image" button
- Simplified timeout UI to single seconds field
- Consistent `a_i` naming throughout
- Simplified quadratic irrational display with decimal approximation
- iOS Safari compatibility fixes

## Common Tasks

**Adding a new feature to the UI:** Edit `src/text_to_display.ts`

**Changing how Z3 results are parsed:** Edit `src/z3_integration.ts`

**Modifying constraint translation:** Edit `src/pr_sat.ts`

**After changes:** Run `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors, then `npx vitest --run` for quick tests.
